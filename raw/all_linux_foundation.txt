Linux Foundation events are working conferences intended for professional networking and collaboration in the Linux community.  Attendees are expected to behave according to professional standards and in accordance with their employer's policies on appropriate workplace behavior.  

While at Linux Foundation events or related social networking opportunities, attendees should not engage in discriminatory or offensive speech or actions regarding gender, sexuality, race, or religion.  Speakers should be especially aware of these concerns.  

The Linux Foundation does not condone any statements by speakers contrary to these standards.  The Linux Foundation reserves the right to deny entrance to any individual.

Please bring any concerns to to the immediate attention of Linux Foundation event staff, or contact Amanda McPherson, Vice President of Marketing at amanda (at) linuxfoundation (dot) org.
