GitHub Inc. events are working conferences intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community. Attendees are expected to behave according to reasonable standards of decency and in accordance with the Golden Rule and any other nondenominational but basically rational thought process that a normal thinking person might apply to a given situation.

While at GitHub Inc. events or related social networking opportunities, attendees should not engage in discriminatory or offensive speech or actions regarding gender, sexuality, race, or religion. Speakers should be especially aware of these concerns â€” this includes sexual or racist images in slides.

GitHub, Inc. does not condone any statements by speakers contrary to these standards. GitHub, Inc. reserves the right to deny entrance to any individual for any reason.

Please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of the GitHub, Inc. event staff, or contact Melissa Severini, Business Operations and Event Coordinator at melissa@github.com. We thank our attendees for their help in keeping GitHub, Inc. events sane, welcoming, and friendly.
